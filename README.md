## EWIN RiverCore training

The following notebooks illustrate how to prepare the EWIN RiverCore sensor network data in python and implement some basic machine learning models for short range water prediction at given node.

The demos are based on only few data points at the moment, the sensor network started measurements only recently. The raw data is in zipped folders and sub-folders and contain many inconsistencies.

The notebooks will show how to explore the data, fix some of it, and reshape it for modeling. 
The goal is mainly to demonstrate the use of data analysis python packages (e.g. [Pandas](https://pandas.io/) ) and also machine learning (e.g. [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/))
